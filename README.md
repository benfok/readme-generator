## Description
Along with a portfolio website. your GitHub repository is an important part of your show reel as a developer. It is the place where you can highlight the projects you are most proud of, and the skills that you possess. Within each project, a well formatted and detailed README file is important to both help other users understand how to use or contribute to your code, and also plays a key role in showcasing your skills to prospective clients. <br> <br> While there is no ‘correct’ way to write a README file, this command line application takes user responses to prompts to quickly create quality, baseline README.md files and help ensure key information is not forgotten.
